# SpecWater - Call for Code

Bringing Artificial Intelligence to monitor water quality and save lives.

## Description:

Over 1.8 billion people on Earth do not have access to adequate sanitation. Therefore, over 10 million people, on their majority kids, die every year due to the lack of safe water. This is a major problem that has been plaguing humanity, especially the poorest population, whose only source of drinking water are rivers that are polluted.
Nowadays, analyzing the water quality is not an easy task. It's necessary for researchers to travel to the region to collect samples and take them to the laboratory, bringing great costs and making it difficult to alert the population. 
Taking that into account, we developed SpecWater, a solution that aims to facilitate this process and make the water quality available to all humanity, in its region and in real time. 
SpecWater uses Artificial Intelligence that analyzes the spectrum of light from the water sample collected by an IoT (a small equipment installed in rivers and lakes). After the analysis, the result will be made available on an easily accessible website, and triggering an alert via SMS to the population who will be able to check the quality of the water and whether it is contaminated or not, in addition to receiving instructions for another form of consumption of drinking water.
The responsible authorities will also be immediately alerted to take action and provide further assistance to the local population.
